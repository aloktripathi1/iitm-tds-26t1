# REST API Service Refactoring

## Task

This Python code violates PEP 8 naming conventions. Several variables and functions use camelCase instead of the Python standard snake_case.

**Your job:**
1. Open `refactor_me.py` in VS Code
2. Use VS Code's "Rename Symbol" feature (F2) to refactor the incorrect names
3. Change camelCase names to snake_case
4. Submit the refactored code

**Important:**
- DO NOT change class names (PascalCase is correct for classes)
- DO NOT change constants (UPPER_CASE is correct for constants)
- Use VS Code's refactoring tools, NOT find-and-replace
- The code intentionally has similar names that should NOT be changed

## How to Use VS Code Rename Symbol

1. Place your cursor on a variable/function name
2. Press **F2** (or right-click → "Rename Symbol")
3. Type the new name
4. Press Enter - VS Code will rename ALL occurrences

This is much faster and safer than manual find-and-replace!

## PEP 8 Naming Conventions

- Functions and variables: `snake_case`
- Classes: `PascalCase`
- Constants: `UPPER_CASE`
